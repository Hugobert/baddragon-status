# baddragon-status

> **UPDATE**: The production status is no longer delivered via JSON and will probably not come back. This project is now deprecated.

Checks your Bad Dragon production status and lists all items in two separate tables (custom and inventory items) next to their individual production status.

Requires Order ID and Token. Uses PHP cURL to retrieve JSON from BD's API.
